## 👋 Hi there

I’m **Akshay R K**, a Senior Full Stack Engineer at **Stellantis**, working on
**cloud-native, event-driven systems** primarily using Python and AWS.

I spend most of my time designing backend platforms and data pipelines, while also
building **full-stack applications** with Node.js, React, and Next.js —
especially internal tools, dashboards, and AI-powered user experiences.

## 🚀 What I Enjoy Building

I enjoy building end-to-end systems where thoughtful backend design meets clean, intuitive user experiences. Over the past 7 years, I’ve worked across Python, AWS, Node.js, React, and Next.js to design and scale cloud-native platforms that integrate multiple systems, process large volumes of data, and remain reliable in real-world production environments.

A lot of my work revolves around event-driven architectures and data pipelines — designing backend services that ingest, transform, and deliver data using Python, FastAPI, and AWS services like Lambda, SQS, SNS, and ECS. At the same time, I enjoy owning the full stack, building dashboards, internal tools, and customer-facing applications with React and Next.js that make complex systems easy to interact with.

More recently, I’ve been working on AI-powered platforms, including RAG-based knowledge systems and LLM integrations, where correctness, observability, and performance matter just as much as innovation. I care deeply about clean architecture, testability, and long-term maintainability, and I actively use AI-assisted development tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor to move faster without cutting corners.

What motivates me most is building systems that feel calm in production — platforms that connect, synchronize, and scale smoothly, even as complexity and load grow.
